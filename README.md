# Surfs up analysis

# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to look at temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round in Oahu, Hawaii.  In addition, I also looked at the precipitation levels for June and December in Oahu.  This analysis will help W. Avy make a decision to either move forward with the business or move on to the next idea.

# Results

I have included an image of the key stats for June and December temperatures.  Following are three of the key differences I noticed when comparing the temperature for June and December.

- The biggest difference is the minimum temperature.  December's minimum recorded temperature is 56° and June's is higher coming in at 64°.
- June's recordings are higher at 1,700 compared to December's temperature recordings of 1,517 which is roughly a 10% reduction in temperature readings between the two months.
- In December, 25% of the readings are at 69° and June is 73°.  Seventy degree weather sounds much warmer than being in the sixties!

# Summary

After comparing June and December temperatures for Oahu, I think that a surf and ice cream shop would do well year-round.  The average temperature is within 4° of each other and the standard deviation for both for June and December are in the same range which tells me that the temperature is typically within the low to mid seventies.

As mentioned, I calculated the stats for the precipitation data for June and December.  In the image below, you can see that the max precipitation happened in December but the average for June and December is .14 and .22 respectively which would not affect the surf and ice cream shop!
