# Surfs up analysis

Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to look at temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine of a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round in Oahu, Hawaii.  In addition, I also looked at the precipitation levels for June and December in Oahu.  This analysis will help W. Avy make a decision to either move forward with the business or move on to the next idea.

Results:

I have included an image of the key stats for June and December temperatures.  Following are three of the key differences I noticed when comparing the temperature for June and December.

- The biggest difference is the minimum temperature.  December's minimum recorded temperature is 56째 and June's is higher coming in at 64째.
- June's recordings are higher at 1,700 compared to December's temperature recordings of 1,517 which is roughly a 10% reduction in temperature readings between the two months.
- In December, 25% of the readings are at 69째 and June is 73째.  Seventy degree weather sounds much warmer than being in the sixties!
